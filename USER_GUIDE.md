## User guide for CareerCompass

This document will guide you on all the features of the CareerCompass application. CareerCompass aims to provide Singaporean students with an easy overview of data from the Graduate Employment Survey, helping students make more informed decisions when choosing a particular course. We provide visualisations that allow students to see the change over time for various statistics for every course, and allow students to compare between courses.
